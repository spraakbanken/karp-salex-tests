Scripts for testing Salex. Can be executed using `karp-cli repl`.

The plan is to build a library for expressing tests which handles
talking to Karp, generating reports and so on, then convert the tests
to use this library. Tests that have not yet been converted live in
the `old` subdirectory.

Tests for the Salex export process are not yet included in this repository.
